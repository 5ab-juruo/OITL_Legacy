# Update Log

## v1.0

Welcome using OITL to programming!

OITL is a source-open project which means you can join our development!

Only use GitHub and Pull-Request, you can make OITL better!

p.s. `guide.md` may exists some other classes. It may show what I'll update next time (^_^).

---

New features:

Added `class segment_tree` !

p.s. You shouldn't use the libraries that I didn't mentioned in the update log. These functions or classes are under construction, so they are really not stable. If you use it, you may meet some strange bugs.(Even Compilation Error ^_^)
